# Your existing training code works unchanged
trainer = YourTrainer(model, training_args, train_dataset, ...)
stats = unsloth_train(trainer)
```

### Production Training with Monitoring
```python
from pantheraml_zoo import (
    setup_production_logging, get_logger, load_config,
    ErrorHandler, get_performance_monitor, unsloth_train
)

# Setup production environment
setup_production_logging(level="INFO", format="json")
logger = get_logger(__name__)
config = load_config()

# Training with full production features
error_handler = ErrorHandler(logger=logger, config=config)
performance_monitor = get_performance_monitor()

with error_handler.context():
    with performance_monitor.training_context():
